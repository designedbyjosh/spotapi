<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The Spotify API is limited in that it can only show music statistics when you're logged in and authorised. Instead, this wrapper will provide you with a link, login and then expose endpoints that mirror the Spotify API so you can check out and publish your listening habits in real time on your own blog, such as mine.
